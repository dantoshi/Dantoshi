	What about a career that "pays you twice"? <br><br> Build an asset while you work.

	Many individuals, often without fully understanding the alternatives, pursue careers that offer little opportunity
	for asset creation alongside their regular wages. Common examples include roles such as a warehouse package handler,
	a hotel restaurant cook, or even an over-the-road truck driver. In these jobs, employees are compensated strictly for
	the hours worked, with no ongoing accumulation or value derived from those hours once they have been paid.
<br> <br>
	A more lucrative approach, by contrast, often involves creating assets that grow in value over time. Consider the
	case of an insurance salesperson who earns commissions per policy sold and builds a book of business that serves as
	a valuable asset. As their customer base expands, they earn recurring income from renewals. Similarly, a software
	engineer may earn a salary, but also receive company stock—a form of equity that typically appreciates in value over
	time. Even a self-employed pool maintenance professional gets compensated twice: once for their ongoing services, and
	again as the value of their pool route increases, turning it into a saleable asset.
<br> <br>
	While traditional wages tend to be consumed by everyday expenses, asset-based income has the potential to grow and
	provide long-term financial security. It’s important to note that there is nothing inherently wrong with jobs that
	pay solely for time worked—they play a crucial role in the economy and create significant value for society. However,
	this perspective aims to make readers more conscious of the choices available. Ultimately, as long as you find fulfillment
	and are contributing value, you’re on a good path.

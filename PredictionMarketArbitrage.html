    Prediction markets offer a unique and profitable opportunity for savvy investors looking to capitalize on pricing discrepancies. In this example,
    we identify an arbitrage opportunity across three major prediction markets—Robinhood, Polymarket, and PredictIt—on potential outcomes for "Trump" vs. "Harris."
    By carefully allocating capital based on the best available prices, you can lock in a risk-free return without needing to predict the outcome.
<br> <br>
    Here’s how it works: the calculator identifies the "Best Price" for each option. For Trump, the best price of $0.530 is available on PredictIt,
    while for Harris, $0.403 on Polymarket is the most favorable. These prices allow us to calculate the implied probabilities:
    <ul>
        <li>Trump: 53.0% probability (1 / 0.530)</li>
        <li>Harris: 40.3% probability (1 / 0.403)</li>
    </ul>
    When we add these probabilities together, we get a total probability of 0.933, which is below 1.0. This means there’s an arbitrage opportunity,
    as indicated by the "Opportunity?" field marked as "TRUE."
<br> <br>
    With a total investment of $10,000 we strategically allocate:
    <ul>
        <li>Trump: $5,680</li>
        <li>Harris: $4,319</li>
    </ul>
    This setup guarantees a profit regardless of the outcome, resulting in a projected Return on Investment (R.O.I.) of $670.
    This approach allows investors to exploit market inefficiencies in prediction markets, generating profit without any directional exposure.

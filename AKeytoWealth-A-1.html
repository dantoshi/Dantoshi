<h1> One of the Keys to Wealth </h1>
<h3> Find or create a career that "pays you twice". <br> Build an asset while you work. </h3>
<br>
<p>
	Many, without full knowledge of the alternate choice, decide to work a job or career that does
	not allow for the creation of an asset alongside their regular wage. Common examples could be, a package
	handler in a warehouse, a cook at a hotel resturant, or even an over-the-road truck driver. These jobs are effectively paid
	for the hours worked. The hours worked do not continue to accumulate or hold value after they have been paid for
	the first and only time.
<br><br>
	A much more prosperous approach often looks like that of the insurance sales man who is
	paid commission per policy sold. He is also paid again as his book of business (the asset) builds value
	as the customer list grows. His customers pay repeatedly every renewal period. Another example of this 
	technique could also be seen being used by the software engineer who is paid both their normal salary and
	then are given company stock (the asset) alongside that wage. The stock generally accumulates and holds value over time. Even a self employed pool boy
	gets paid twice. Once for his monthly cleaning/maintinace labor and again as the pool route (the asset)
	grows and accumulates value over time.
<br><br>
	These assets often build value
	steadily while regular wages are often spent on everyday expenses. There is nothing wrong with working a
	job that only pays you once. We need people to work those jobs as they create immense value for society.
	This was written only to ensure you are aware of the choice you are making. As long as you are
	happy and creating value, then you are doing pretty good in my opinion.
